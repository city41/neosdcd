# League Bowling vs Puzzle Bobble

This comparison is being done since PB has no redbook, and LB has a single redbook track. So these two might make it easier to figure out the redbook metadata.

## Truncating kills redbook

truncating lbowling.neo to be the same size as pbobblencd.neo (4384 bytes) causes lbowling to still work just fine, minus the redbook audio track playing.

Seems redbook data starts at offset 4384.
