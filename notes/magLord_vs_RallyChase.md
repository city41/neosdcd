# Mag Lord and Rally Chase exploration

## swapping ISO's kind of works

using ralchase.neo and having mag lord iso data in ralchase/, when playing mag lord does load and plays just fine. Noted issues are some graphical glitches on the fixed layer and no redbook audio plays. Sound effects play just fine.
