# neosdcd

This repo is an effort to reverse engineer how the NeoSD Pro loads CD games. The goal is to create new .neo files for the remainder of the Neo Geo CD library, as well as homebrew Neo CD games.

Depending on how this plays out (and if I succeed), I may end up adding a "create CD .neo" feature to [neosdconv](https://github.com/city41/neosdconv)

## Status

Very early, only been at this for about a day. But so far, so good and am optimistic.

## Help Wanted

Do you know about Neo CDs or how the NeoSD Pro loads them? Please share whatever you know.
